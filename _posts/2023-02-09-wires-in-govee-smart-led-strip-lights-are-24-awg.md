title: "Wires in Govee LED Strip Lights are 24 AWG"

I cut the remote-only controller off of a Govee LED strip light set, and spliced the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Remote controller from a newer Govee set on to the existring strips. Since the existing strips are instaled in a room and can't be moved to a work area, I didn't want to use solder to connect them. To use butt splice connector I needed to know the guage of the wire, but I couldn't remember if I used the 24 or 26 guage (AWG) spot on my wire stripping tool. I used a digital caliper to determine that the four wires inside the cable are 24 AWG each.

As usual, I'm sharing this here in case it helps a search engine traveler down the road.
