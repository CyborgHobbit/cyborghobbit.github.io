On August 10th our city in Eastern Iowa was rocked by over 100-mph straight-line winds from a type of storm called a [derecho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho). [65 percent of the tree canopy was destoyed](https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/iowa-derecho-cedar-rapids-tree-canopy-loss-land-hurricane-20200827), many homes were destroyed or made unlivable until repaired, power was out for over a week for most of the city, and now three weeks later many people (including us) still don't have broadband internet service restored at their homes.
