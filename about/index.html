			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm an IT professional working in higher education and living in Iowa with a family and a handful of dogs. I enjoy science fiction in many forms. Fall is my favorite time of year, with Winter coming in second. Sad songs make me cry. I enjoy tabletop games and PC games.
			<p>I love my ebooks, but I miss physical books. I enjoy visiting the library and book stores.</p>
