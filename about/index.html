			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm an IT professional living in Iowa with a wife, two children, and a handful of dogs. I enjoy science fiction in many forms. Fall is my favorite time of year, with Winter coming in second. Sad songs make me cry. Before the pandemic I met with one group of friends once a week to play tabletop games, and other group (with some crossover) to play pen and paper RPGs.</p>
			<p>I love my Kindle, but I miss physical books. I enjoy visiting the library and book stores.</p>
